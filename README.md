This project delves into Speaker Verification and Identification through a Comprehensive approach with an achieved accuracy of 93.1% by applying the GMM model including techniques such as chunking noise, noise augmentation, and human voice layover. MFCCs, Delta and Double Delta, LPC, and LBD for feature extraction then applying PCA for dimensionality reduction.
